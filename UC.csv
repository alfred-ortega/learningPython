- Providing valid credentials for all available   authentication protocols may improve scan coverage, but   the value of successful authentication for a given   protocol may vary from target to target depending upon   what data (if any) is gathered from the target via that   protocol. For example, successful authentication via SSH   is more valuable for Linux targets than for Windows   targets, and likewise successful authentication via SMB   is more valuable for Windows targets than for Linux   targets.","","","","","IAVB #0001-B-0504","Mar 28, 2025 03:15:54 EDT","Mar 28, 2025 04:07:35 EDT","N/A","N/A"

Failed to authenticate using the supplied password.","Nessus was unable to log into the detected authentication protocol, using the provided credentials, in order to perform credentialed checks.","Nessus failed to successfully authenticate directly to the remote target on an available authentication protocol. Nessus was able to connect to the remote port and identify that the service running on the port supports an authentication protocol, but Nessus failed to authenticate to the remote service using the provided credentials.

There may have been a failure in protocol negotiation or communication that prevented authentication from being attempted or all of the provided credentials for the authentication protocol may have been invalid. A protocol failure may indicate a compatibility issue with the protocol configuration. A protocol failure due to an environmental issue such as resource or congestion issues may also prevent valid credentials from being identified. See plugin output for error details.

Please note the following :

- This plugin reports per protocol, so it is possible for   valid credentials to be provided for one protocol and not   another. For example, authentication may succeed via SSH   but fail via SMB, while no credentials were provided for   an available SNMP service.

- Providing valid credentials for all available   authentication protocols may improve scan coverage, but   the value of successful authentication for a given   protocol may vary from target to target depending upon   what data (if any) is gathered from the target via that   protocol. For example, successful authentication via SSH   is more valuable for Linux targets than for Windows   targets, and likewise successful authentication via SMB   is more valuable for Windows targets than for Linux   targets.","Address the reported problem(s) so that credentialed checks can be executed.","","","","IAVB #0001-B-0503","Nov 21, 2023 22:35:56 EST","Mar 23, 2025 18:16:56 EDT","N/A","N/A"

Nessus was able to connect to the remote port and identify that the service running on the port supports an authentication protocol, but Nessus failed to authenticate to the remote service using the provided credentials.

There may have been a failure in protocol negotiation or communication that prevented authentication from being attempted or all of the provided credentials for the authentication protocol may have been invalid. A protocol failure may indicate a compatibility issue with the protocol configuration. A protocol failure due to an environmental issue such as resource or congestion issues may also prevent valid credentials from being identified. See plugin output for error details.

Please note the following :

- This plugin reports per protocol, so it is possible for   valid credentials to be provided for one protocol and not   another. For example, authentication may succeed via SSH   but fail via SMB, while no credentials were provided for   an available SNMP service.

- Providing valid credentials for all available   authentication protocols may improve scan coverage, but   the value of successful authentication for a given   protocol may vary from target to target depending upon   what data (if any) is gathered from the target via that   protocol. For example, successful authentication via SSH   is more valuable for Linux targets than for Windows   targets, and likewise successful authentication via SMB   is more valuable for Windows targets than for Linux   targets.","Address the reported problem(s) so that credentialed checks can be executed.","","","","IAVB #0001-B-0503","Jun 9, 2024 17:42:36 EDT","Apr 1, 2025 05:29:23 EDT","N/A","N/A"

  - A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Expressway Series could allow an     unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against a user of the     interface. This vulnerability exists because the web-based management interface does not properly validate     user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the interface to     click a crafted link.

Failed to authenticate with supplied password using keyboard-interactive authentication.","Nessus was unable to log into the detected authentication protocol, using the provided credentials, in order to perform credentialed checks.","Nessus failed to successfully authenticate directly to the remote target on an available authentication protocol. Nessus was able to connect to the remote port and identify that the service running on the port supports an authentication protocol, but Nessus failed to authenticate to the remote service using the provided credentials.

There may have been a failure in protocol negotiation or communication that prevented authentication from being attempted or all of the provided credentials for the authentication protocol may have been invalid. A protocol failure may indicate a compatibility issue with the protocol configuration. A protocol failure due to an environmental issue such as resource or congestion issues may also prevent valid credentials from being identified. See plugin output for error details.

Please note the following :

- This plugin reports per protocol, so it is possible for   valid credentials to be provided for one protocol and not   another. For example, authentication may succeed via SSH   but fail via SMB, while no credentials were provided for   an available SNMP service.

- Providing valid credentials for all available   authentication protocols may improve scan coverage, but   the value of successful authentication for a given   protocol may vary from target to target depending upon   what data (if any) is gathered from the target via that   protocol. For example, successful authentication via SSH   is more valuable for Linux targets than for Windows   targets, and likewise successful authentication via SMB   is more valuable for Windows targets than for Linux   targets.","Address the reported problem(s) so that credentialed checks can be executed.","","","","IAVB #0001-B-0503","Oct 22, 2023 19:19:08 EDT","Mar 23, 2025 18:16:56 EDT","N/A","N/A"

  - A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Expressway Series could allow an     unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against a user of the     interface. This vulnerability exists because the web-based management interface does not properly validate     user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the interface to     click a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in     the context of the affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based information. Note:Cisco     Expressway Series refers to Cisco Expressway Control (Expressway-C) devices and Cisco Expressway Edge     (Expressway-E) devices. (CVE-2025-20179)

Please note the following :

- This plugin reports per protocol, so it is possible for   valid credentials to be provided for one protocol and not   another. For example, authentication may succeed via SSH   but fail via SMB, while no credentials were provided for   an available SNMP service.

- Providing valid credentials for all available   authentication protocols may improve scan coverage, but   the value of successful authentication for a given   protocol may vary from target to target depending upon   what data (if any) is gathered from the target via that   protocol. For example, successful authentication via SSH   is more valuable for Linux targets than for Windows   targets, and likewise successful authentication via SMB   is more valuable for Windows targets than for Linux   targets.","","","","","IAVB #0001-B-0504","Mar 28, 2025 03:15:54 EDT","Mar 28, 2025 04:07:35 EDT","N/A","N/A"

Failed to authenticate using the supplied password.","Nessus was unable to log into the detected authentication protocol, using the provided credentials, in order to perform credentialed checks.","Nessus failed to successfully authenticate directly to the remote target on an available authentication protocol. Nessus was able to connect to the remote port and identify that the service running on the port supports an authentication protocol, but Nessus failed to authenticate to the remote service using the provided credentials.

There may have been a failure in protocol negotiation or communication that prevented authentication from being attempted or all of the provided credentials for the authentication protocol may have been invalid. A protocol failure may indicate a compatibility issue with the protocol configuration. A protocol failure due to an environmental issue such as resource or congestion issues may also prevent valid credentials from being identified. See plugin output for error details.

Please note the following :

- This plugin reports per protocol, so it is possible for   valid credentials to be provided for one protocol and not   another. For example, authentication may succeed via SSH   but fail via SMB, while no credentials were provided for   an available SNMP service.

- Providing valid credentials for all available   authentication protocols may improve scan coverage, but   the value of successful authentication for a given   protocol may vary from target to target depending upon   what data (if any) is gathered from the target via that   protocol. For example, successful authentication via SSH   is more valuable for Linux targets than for Windows   targets, and likewise successful authentication via SMB   is more valuable for Windows targets than for Linux   targets.","Address the reported problem(s) so that credentialed checks can be executed.","","","","IAVB #0001-B-0503","Feb 12, 2023 20:39:00 EST","Mar 23, 2025 18:16:56 EDT","N/A","N/A"

There are several possible reasons for this :

  - The scan may have caused a service to freeze or stop     running.

  - An administrator may have stopped a particular service     during the scanning process.

This might be an availability problem related to the following :

  - A network outage has been experienced during the scan,     and the remote network cannot be reached anymore by the     scanner.

  - This scanner may has been blacklisted by the system     administrator or by an automatic intrusion detection /     prevention system that detected the scan.

  - The remote host is now down, either because a user     turned it off during the scan or because a select denial     of service was effective.

In any case, the audit of the remote host might be incomplete and may need to be done again.","Steps to resolve this issue include :

- Increase checks_read_timeout and/or reduce max_checks.

- Disable any IPS during the Nessus scan","","","","IAVB #0001-B-0509","Mar 9, 2025 18:10:40 EDT","Mar 23, 2025 18:16:56 EDT","N/A","N/A"

There are several possible reasons for this :

  - The scan may have caused a service to freeze or stop     running.

  - An administrator may have stopped a particular service     during the scanning process.

This might be an availability problem related to the following :

  - A network outage has been experienced during the scan,     and the remote network cannot be reached anymore by the     scanner.

  - This scanner may has been blacklisted by the system     administrator or by an automatic intrusion detection /     prevention system that detected the scan.

  - The remote host is now down, either because a user     turned it off during the scan or because a select denial     of service was effective.

In any case, the audit of the remote host might be incomplete and may need to be done again.","Steps to resolve this issue include :

- Increase checks_read_timeout and/or reduce max_checks.

- Disable any IPS during the Nessus scan","","","","IAVB #0001-B-0509","Jan 12, 2023 00:37:03 EST","Mar 23, 2025 18:16:56 EDT","N/A","N/A"

A protocol failure may indicate a compatibility issue with the protocol configuration. A protocol failure due to an environmental issue such as resource or congestion issues may also prevent valid credentials from being identified. See plugin output for error details.

Please note the following :

- This plugin reports per protocol, so it is possible for   valid credentials to be provided for one protocol and not   another. For example, authentication may succeed via SSH   but fail via SMB, while no credentials were provided for   an available SNMP service.

- Providing valid credentials for all available   authentication protocols may improve scan coverage, but   the value of successful authentication for a given   protocol may vary from target to target depending upon   what data (if any) is gathered from the target via that   protocol. For example, successful authentication via SSH   is more valuable for Linux targets than for Windows   targets, and likewise successful authentication via SMB   is more valuable for Windows targets than for Linux   targets.","Address the reported problem(s) so that credentialed checks can be executed.","","","","IAVB #0001-B-0503","Jan 12, 2023 00:37:03 EST","Mar 23, 2025 18:16:56 EDT","N/A","N/A"

Port 5061 was detected as being open but is now closed","Previously open ports are now closed.","One of several ports that were previously open are now closed or unresponsive.

There are several possible reasons for this :

  - The scan may have caused a service to freeze or stop     running.

  - An administrator may have stopped a particular service     during the scanning process.

This might be an availability problem related to the following :

  - A network outage has been experienced during the scan,     and the remote network cannot be reached anymore by the     scanner.

  - This scanner may has been blacklisted by the system     administrator or by an automatic intrusion detection /     prevention system that detected the scan.

  - The remote host is now down, either because a user     turned it off during the scan or because a select denial     of service was effective.

In any case, the audit of the remote host might be incomplete and may need to be done again.","Steps to resolve this issue include :

- Increase checks_read_timeout and/or reduce max_checks.

- Disable any IPS during the Nessus scan","","","","IAVB #0001-B-0509","Jan 12, 2023 00:37:03 EST","Mar 23, 2025 18:16:56 EDT","N/A","N/A"

Nessus was able to connect to the remote port and identify that the service running on the port supports an authentication protocol, but Nessus failed to authenticate to the remote service using the provided credentials.

There may have been a failure in protocol negotiation or communication that prevented authentication from being attempted or all of the provided credentials for the authentication protocol may have been invalid. A protocol failure may indicate a compatibility issue with the protocol configuration. A protocol failure due to an environmental issue such as resource or congestion issues may also prevent valid credentials from being identified. See plugin output for error details.

Please note the following :

- This plugin reports per protocol, so it is possible for   valid credentials to be provided for one protocol and not   another. For example, authentication may succeed via SSH   but fail via SMB, while no credentials were provided for   an available SNMP service.

- Providing valid credentials for all available   authentication protocols may improve scan coverage, but   the value of successful authentication for a given   protocol may vary from target to target depending upon   what data (if any) is gathered from the target via that   protocol.

Port 443 was detected as being open initially but was found unresponsive later.
 It is now open.","Previously open ports are now closed.","One of several ports that were previously open are now closed or unresponsive.

There are several possible reasons for this :

  - The scan may have caused a service to freeze or stop     running.

  - An administrator may have stopped a particular service     during the scanning process.

This might be an availability problem related to the following :

  - A network outage has been experienced during the scan,     and the remote network cannot be reached anymore by the     scanner.

  - This scanner may has been blacklisted by the system     administrator or by an automatic intrusion detection /     prevention system that detected the scan.

  - The remote host is now down, either because a user     turned it off during the scan or because a select denial     of service was effective.

In any case, the audit of the remote host might be incomplete and may need to be done again.","Steps to resolve this issue include :

- Increase checks_read_timeout and/or reduce max_checks.

- Disable any IPS during the Nessus scan","","","","IAVB #0001-B-0509","Jan 12, 2023 00:37:03 EST","Mar 23, 2025 18:16:56 EDT","N/A","N/A"

Nessus was able to connect to the remote port and identify that the service running on the port supports an authentication protocol, but Nessus failed to authenticate to the remote service using the provided credentials.

There may have been a failure in protocol negotiation or communication that prevented authentication from being attempted or all of the provided credentials for the authentication protocol may have been invalid. A protocol failure may indicate a compatibility issue with the protocol configuration. A protocol failure due to an environmental issue such as resource or congestion issues may also prevent valid credentials from being identified. See plugin output for error details.

Please note the following :

- This plugin reports per protocol, so it is possible for   valid credentials to be provided for one protocol and not   another. For example, authentication may succeed via SSH   but fail via SMB, while no credentials were provided for   an available SNMP service.

- Providing valid credentials for all available   authentication protocols may improve scan coverage, but   the value of successful authentication for a given   protocol may vary from target to target depending upon   what data (if any) is gathered from the target via that   protocol. For example, successful authentication via SSH   is more valuable for Linux targets than for Windows   targets, and likewise successful authentication via SMB   is more valuable for Windows targets than for Linux   targets.","Address the reported problem(s) so that credentialed checks can be executed.","","","","IAVB #0001-B-0503","Jan 12, 2023 00:37:03 EST","Mar 23, 2025 18:16:56 EDT","N/A","N/A"

There are several possible reasons for this :

  - The scan may have caused a service to freeze or stop     running.

  - An administrator may have stopped a particular service     during the scanning process.

This might be an availability problem related to the following :

  - A network outage has been experienced during the scan,     and the remote network cannot be reached anymore by the     scanner.

  - This scanner may has been blacklisted by the system     administrator or by an automatic intrusion detection /     prevention system that detected the scan.

  - The remote host is now down, either because a user     turned it off during the scan or because a select denial     of service was effective.

In any case, the audit of the remote host might be incomplete and may need to be done again.","Steps to resolve this issue include :

- Increase checks_read_timeout and/or reduce max_checks.

Many frameworks and languages treat 'HEAD' as a 'GET' request, albeit one without any body in the response.

Nessus was able to connect to the remote port and identify that the service running on the port supports an authentication protocol, but Nessus failed to authenticate to the remote service using the provided credentials.

There may have been a failure in protocol negotiation or communication that prevented authentication from being attempted or all of the provided credentials for the authentication protocol may have been invalid. A protocol failure may indicate a compatibility issue with the protocol configuration. A protocol failure due to an environmental issue such as resource or congestion issues may also prevent valid credentials from being identified. See plugin output for error details.

Please note the following :

- This plugin reports per protocol, so it is possible for   valid credentials to be provided for one protocol and not   another. For example, authentication may succeed via SSH   but fail via SMB, while no credentials were provided for   an available SNMP service.

- Providing valid credentials for all available   authentication protocols may improve scan coverage, but   the value of successful authentication for a given   protocol may vary from target to target depending upon   what data (if any) is gathered from the target via that   protocol. For example, successful authentication via SSH   is more valuable for Linux targets than for Windows   targets, and likewise successful authentication via SMB   is more valuable for Windows targets than for Linux   targets.","Address the reported problem(s) so that credentialed checks can be executed.","","","","IAVB #0001-B-0503","Jan 12, 2023 00:37:03 EST","Mar 23, 2025 18:16:56 EDT","N/A","N/A"

Nessus was able to connect to the remote port and identify that the service running on the port supports an authentication protocol, but Nessus failed to authenticate to the remote service using the provided credentials.

There may have been a failure in protocol negotiation or communication that prevented authentication from being attempted or all of the provided credentials for the authentication protocol may have been invalid. A protocol failure may indicate a compatibility issue with the protocol configuration. A protocol failure due to an environmental issue such as resource or congestion issues may also prevent valid credentials from being identified. See plugin output for error details.

Please note the following :

- This plugin reports per protocol, so it is possible for   valid credentials to be provided for one protocol and not   another. For example, authentication may succeed via SSH   but fail via SMB, while no credentials were provided for   an available SNMP service.

- Providing valid credentials for all available   authentication protocols may improve scan coverage, but   the value of successful authentication for a given   protocol may vary from target to target depending upon   what data (if any) is gathered from the target via that   protocol. For example, successful authentication via SSH   is more valuable for Linux targets than for Windows   targets, and likewise successful authentication via SMB   is more valuable for Windows targets than for Linux   targets.","Address the reported problem(s) so that credentialed checks can be executed.","","","","IAVB #0001-B-0503","Jan 12, 2023 00:37:03 EST","Mar 23, 2025 18:16:56 EDT","N/A","N/A"

Port 5061 was detected as being open but is now closed","Previously open ports are now closed.","One of several ports that were previously open are now closed or unresponsive.

There are several possible reasons for this :

  - The scan may have caused a service to freeze or stop     running.

  - An administrator may have stopped a particular service     during the scanning process.

This might be an availability problem related to the following :

  - A network outage has been experienced during the scan,     and the remote network cannot be reached anymore by the     scanner.

  - This scanner may has been blacklisted by the system     administrator or by an automatic intrusion detection /     prevention system that detected the scan.

  - The remote host is now down, either because a user     turned it off during the scan or because a select denial     of service was effective.

In any case, the audit of the remote host might be incomplete and may need to be done again.","Steps to resolve this issue include :

- Increase checks_read_timeout and/or reduce max_checks.

- Disable any IPS during the Nessus scan","","","","IAVB #0001-B-0509","Oct 24, 2021 18:08:04 EDT","Mar 23, 2025 18:16:56 EDT","N/A","N/A"

Nessus was able to connect to the remote port and identify that the service running on the port supports an authentication protocol, but Nessus failed to authenticate to the remote service using the provided credentials.

There may have been a failure in protocol negotiation or communication that prevented authentication from being attempted or all of the provided credentials for the authentication protocol may have been invalid. A protocol failure may indicate a compatibility issue with the protocol configuration. A protocol failure due to an environmental issue such as resource or congestion issues may also prevent valid credentials from being identified. See plugin output for error details.

Please note the following :

- This plugin reports per protocol, so it is possible for   valid credentials to be provided for one protocol and not   another. For example, authentication may succeed via SSH   but fail via SMB, while no credentials were provided for   an available SNMP service.

- Providing valid credentials for all available   authentication protocols may improve scan coverage, but   the value of successful authentication for a given   protocol may vary from target to target depending upon   what data (if any) is gathered from the target via that   protocol. For example, successful authentication via SSH   is more valuable for Linux targets than for Windows   targets, and likewise successful authentication via SMB   is more valuable for Windows targets than for Linux   targets.","Address the reported problem(s) so that credentialed checks can be executed.","","","","IAVB #0001-B-0503","Oct 30, 2022 21:57:36 EDT","Mar 23, 2025 18:16:56 EDT","N/A","N/A"

Failed to authenticate with supplied password using keyboard-interactive authentication.","Nessus was unable to log into the detected authentication protocol, using the provided credentials, in order to perform credentialed checks.","Nessus failed to successfully authenticate directly to the remote target on an available authentication protocol. Nessus was able to connect to the remote port and identify that the service running on the port supports an authentication protocol, but Nessus failed to authenticate to the remote service using the provided credentials.

There may have been a failure in protocol negotiation or communication that prevented authentication from being attempted or all of the provided credentials for the authentication protocol may have been invalid. A protocol failure may indicate a compatibility issue with the protocol configuration. A protocol failure due to an environmental issue such as resource or congestion issues may also prevent valid credentials from being identified. See plugin output for error details.

Please note the following :

- This plugin reports per protocol, so it is possible for   valid credentials to be provided for one protocol and not   another. For example, authentication may succeed via SSH   but fail via SMB, while no credentials were provided for   an available SNMP service.

- Providing valid credentials for all available   authentication protocols may improve scan coverage, but   the value of successful authentication for a given   protocol may vary from target to target depending upon   what data (if any) is gathered from the target via that   protocol. For example, successful authentication via SSH   is more valuable for Linux targets than for Windows   targets, and likewise successful authentication via SMB   is more valuable for Windows targets than for Linux   targets.","Address the reported problem(s) so that credentialed checks can be executed.","","","","IAVB #0001-B-0503","Jan 12, 2023 00:37:03 EST","Mar 23, 2025 18:16:56 EDT","N/A","N/A"

  - A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Expressway Series could allow an     unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against a user of the     interface. This vulnerability exists because the web-based management interface does not properly validate     user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the interface to     click a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in     the context of the affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based information. Note:Cisco     Expressway Series refers to Cisco Expressway Control (Expressway-C) devices and Cisco Expressway Edge     (Expressway-E) devices. (CVE-2025-20179)

Nessus was able to connect to the remote port and identify that the service running on the port supports an authentication protocol, but Nessus failed to authenticate to the remote service using the provided credentials.

There may have been a failure in protocol negotiation or communication that prevented authentication from being attempted or all of the provided credentials for the authentication protocol may have been invalid. A protocol failure may indicate a compatibility issue with the protocol configuration. A protocol failure due to an environmental issue such as resource or congestion issues may also prevent valid credentials from being identified. See plugin output for error details.

Please note the following :

- This plugin reports per protocol, so it is possible for   valid credentials to be provided for one protocol and not   another. For example, authentication may succeed via SSH   but fail via SMB, while no credentials were provided for   an available SNMP service.

- Providing valid credentials for all available   authentication protocols may improve scan coverage, but   the value of successful authentication for a given   protocol may vary from target to target depending upon   what data (if any) is gathered from the target via that   protocol. For example, successful authentication via SSH   is more valuable for Linux targets than for Windows   targets, and likewise successful authentication via SMB   is more valuable for Windows targets than for Linux   targets.","Address the reported problem(s) so that credentialed checks can be executed.","","","","IAVB #0001-B-0503","Mar 28, 2021 18:56:32 EDT","Mar 23, 2025 18:16:56 EDT","N/A","N/A"

Port 5061 was detected as being open but is now closed
Port 443 was detected as being open initially but was found unresponsive later.
 It is now open.","Previously open ports are now closed.","One of several ports that were previously open are now closed or unresponsive.

There are several possible reasons for this :

  - The scan may have caused a service to freeze or stop     running.

  - An administrator may have stopped a particular service     during the scanning process.

This might be an availability problem related to the following :

  - A network outage has been experienced during the scan,     and the remote network cannot be reached anymore by the     scanner.

  - This scanner may has been blacklisted by the system     administrator or by an automatic intrusion detection /     prevention system that detected the scan.

  - The remote host is now down, either because a user     turned it off during the scan or because a select denial     of service was effective.

In any case, the audit of the remote host might be incomplete and may need to be done again.","Steps to resolve this issue include :

- Increase checks_read_timeout and/or reduce max_checks.

- Disable any IPS during the Nessus scan","","","","IAVB #0001-B-0509","Jan 12, 2023 00:37:03 EST","Mar 23, 2025 18:16:56 EDT","N/A","N/A"

Nessus was able to connect to the remote port and identify that the service running on the port supports an authentication protocol, but Nessus failed to authenticate to the remote service using the provided credentials.

There may have been a failure in protocol negotiation or communication that prevented authentication from being attempted or all of the provided credentials for the authentication protocol may have been invalid. A protocol failure may indicate a compatibility issue with the protocol configuration. A protocol failure due to an environmental issue such as resource or congestion issues may also prevent valid credentials from being identified. See plugin output for error details.

Please note the following :

- This plugin reports per protocol, so it is possible for   valid credentials to be provided for one protocol and not   another. For example, authentication may succeed via SSH   but fail via SMB, while no credentials were provided for   an available SNMP service.

- Providing valid credentials for all available   authentication protocols may improve scan coverage, but   the value of successful authentication for a given   protocol may vary from target to target depending upon   what data (if any) is gathered from the target via that   protocol. For example, successful authentication via SSH   is more valuable for Linux targets than for Windows   targets, and likewise successful authentication via SMB   is more valuable for Windows targets than for Linux   targets.","Address the reported problem(s) so that credentialed checks can be executed.","","","","IAVB #0001-B-0503","Jan 12, 2023 00:37:03 EST","Mar 23, 2025 18:16:56 EDT","N/A","N/A"

  Installed release : 12.5.1
  Fixed release     : See vendor advisory","The remote device is missing a vendor-supplied security patch.","According to its self-reported version, Cisco Unified Communications Manager running on the report host is affected by a cross-site scripting vulnerability that could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct an attack against a user of the interface. This vulnerability exists because the web-based management interface does not properly validate user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the interface to click a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based information.

Port 443 was detected as being open initially but was found unresponsive later.
 It is now open.","Previously open ports are now closed.","One of several ports that were previously open are now closed or unresponsive.

There are several possible reasons for this :

  - The scan may have caused a service to freeze or stop     running.

  - An administrator may have stopped a particular service     during the scanning process.

This might be an availability problem related to the following :

  - A network outage has been experienced during the scan,     and the remote network cannot be reached anymore by the     scanner.

  - This scanner may has been blacklisted by the system     administrator or by an automatic intrusion detection /     prevention system that detected the scan.

  - The remote host is now down, either because a user     turned it off during the scan or because a select denial     of service was effective.

In any case, the audit of the remote host might be incomplete and may need to be done again.","Steps to resolve this issue include :

- Increase checks_read_timeout and/or reduce max_checks.

- Disable any IPS during the Nessus scan","","","","IAVB #0001-B-0509","Jan 12, 2023 00:37:03 EST","Mar 23, 2025 18:16:56 EDT","N/A","N/A"

Nessus was able to connect to the remote port and identify that the service running on the port supports an authentication protocol, but Nessus failed to authenticate to the remote service using the provided credentials.

There may have been a failure in protocol negotiation or communication that prevented authentication from being attempted or all of the provided credentials for the authentication protocol may have been invalid. A protocol failure may indicate a compatibility issue with the protocol configuration. A protocol failure due to an environmental issue such as resource or congestion issues may also prevent valid credentials from being identified. See plugin output for error details.

Please note the following :

- This plugin reports per protocol, so it is possible for   valid credentials to be provided for one protocol and not   another. For example, authentication may succeed via SSH   but fail via SMB, while no credentials were provided for   an available SNMP service.

- Providing valid credentials for all available   authentication protocols may improve scan coverage, but   the value of successful authentication for a given   protocol may vary from target to target depending upon   what data (if any) is gathered from the target via that   protocol. For example, successful authentication via SSH   is more valuable for Linux targets than for Windows   targets, and likewise successful authentication via SMB   is more valuable for Windows targets than for Linux   targets.","Address the reported problem(s) so that credentialed checks can be executed.","","","","IAVB #0001-B-0503","Jan 12, 2023 00:37:03 EST","Mar 23, 2025 18:16:56 EDT","N/A","N/A"

This vulnerability exists because the web-based management interface does not properly validate user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the interface to click a crafted link.

Failed to authenticate using the supplied password.","Nessus was unable to log into the detected authentication protocol, using the provided credentials, in order to perform credentialed checks.","Nessus failed to successfully authenticate directly to the remote target on an available authentication protocol. Nessus was able to connect to the remote port and identify that the service running on the port supports an authentication protocol, but Nessus failed to authenticate to the remote service using the provided credentials.

There may have been a failure in protocol negotiation or communication that prevented authentication from being attempted or all of the provided credentials for the authentication protocol may have been invalid. A protocol failure may indicate a compatibility issue with the protocol configuration. A protocol failure due to an environmental issue such as resource or congestion issues may also prevent valid credentials from being identified. See plugin output for error details.

Please note the following :

- This plugin reports per protocol, so it is possible for   valid credentials to be provided for one protocol and not   another. For example, authentication may succeed via SSH   but fail via SMB, while no credentials were provided for   an available SNMP service.

- Providing valid credentials for all available   authentication protocols may improve scan coverage, but   the value of successful authentication for a given   protocol may vary from target to target depending upon   what data (if any) is gathered from the target via that   protocol. For example, successful authentication via SSH   is more valuable for Linux targets than for Windows   targets, and likewise successful authentication via SMB   is more valuable for Windows targets than for Linux   targets.","Address the reported problem(s) so that credentialed checks can be executed.","","","","IAVB #0001-B-0503","Jan 12, 2023 00:37:03 EST","Mar 23, 2025 18:16:56 EDT","N/A","N/A"

    /","This plugin determines which HTTP methods are allowed on various CGI directories.","By calling the OPTIONS method, it is possible to determine which HTTP methods are allowed on each directory.

The following HTTP methods are considered insecure:
  PUT, DELETE, CONNECT, TRACE, HEAD

Many frameworks and languages treat 'HEAD' as a 'GET' request, albeit one without any body in the response. If a security constraint was set on 'GET' requests such that only 'authenticatedUsers' could access GET requests for a particular servlet or resource, it would be bypassed for the 'HEAD' version. This allowed unauthorized blind submission of any privileged GET request.

As this list may be incomplete, the plugin also tests - if 'Thorough tests' are enabled or 'Enable web applications tests' is set to 'yes' in the scan policy - various known HTTP methods on each directory and considers them as unsupported if it receives a response code of 400, 403, 405, or 501.

Nessus was able to connect to the remote port and identify that the service running on the port supports an authentication protocol, but Nessus failed to authenticate to the remote service using the provided credentials.

There may have been a failure in protocol negotiation or communication that prevented authentication from being attempted or all of the provided credentials for the authentication protocol may have been invalid. A protocol failure may indicate a compatibility issue with the protocol configuration. A protocol failure due to an environmental issue such as resource or congestion issues may also prevent valid credentials from being identified. See plugin output for error details.

Please note the following :

- This plugin reports per protocol, so it is possible for   valid credentials to be provided for one protocol and not   another. For example, authentication may succeed via SSH   but fail via SMB, while no credentials were provided for   an available SNMP service.

- Providing valid credentials for all available   authentication protocols may improve scan coverage, but   the value of successful authentication for a given   protocol may vary from target to target depending upon   what data (if any) is gathered from the target via that   protocol. For example, successful authentication via SSH   is more valuable for Linux targets than for Windows   targets, and likewise successful authentication via SMB   is more valuable for Windows targets than for Linux   targets.","Address the reported problem(s) so that credentialed checks can be executed.","","","","IAVB #0001-B-0503","Nov 20, 2023 20:38:31 EST","Mar 23, 2025 18:16:56 EDT","N/A","N/A"

SSH local checks were not enabled.","Nessus was able to find common ports used for local checks, however, no credentials were provided in the scan policy.","Nessus was not able to successfully authenticate directly to the remote target on an available authentication protocol. Nessus was able to connect to the remote port and identify that the service running on the port supports an authentication protocol, but Nessus failed to authenticate to the remote service using the provided credentials. There may have been a protocol failure that prevented authentication from being attempted or all of the provided credentials for the authentication protocol may be invalid. See plugin output for error details.

Please note the following :

- This plugin reports per protocol, so it is possible for   valid credentials to be provided for one protocol and not   another. For example, authentication may succeed via SSH   but fail via SMB, while no credentials were provided for   an available SNMP service.

- Providing valid credentials for all available   authentication protocols may improve scan coverage, but   the value of successful authentication for a given   protocol may vary from target to target depending upon   what data (if any) is gathered from the target via that   protocol. For example, successful authentication via SSH   is more valuable for Linux targets than for Windows   targets, and likewise successful authentication via SMB   is more valuable for Windows targets than for Linux   targets.","","","","","IAVB #0001-B-0504","Mar 28, 2025 03:15:54 EDT","Mar 28, 2025 04:07:35 EDT","N/A","N/A"

Failed to authenticate with supplied password using keyboard-interactive authentication.","Nessus was unable to log into the detected authentication protocol, using the provided credentials, in order to perform credentialed checks.","Nessus failed to successfully authenticate directly to the remote target on an available authentication protocol. Nessus was able to connect to the remote port and identify that the service running on the port supports an authentication protocol, but Nessus failed to authenticate to the remote service using the provided credentials.

There may have been a failure in protocol negotiation or communication that prevented authentication from being attempted or all of the provided credentials for the authentication protocol may have been invalid. A protocol failure may indicate a compatibility issue with the protocol configuration. A protocol failure due to an environmental issue such as resource or congestion issues may also prevent valid credentials from being identified. See plugin output for error details.

Please note the following :

- This plugin reports per protocol, so it is possible for   valid credentials to be provided for one protocol and not   another. For example, authentication may succeed via SSH   but fail via SMB, while no credentials were provided for   an available SNMP service.

- Providing valid credentials for all available   authentication protocols may improve scan coverage, but   the value of successful authentication for a given   protocol may vary from target to target depending upon   what data (if any) is gathered from the target via that   protocol. For example, successful authentication via SSH   is more valuable for Linux targets than for Windows   targets, and likewise successful authentication via SMB   is more valuable for Windows targets than for Linux   targets.","Address the reported problem(s) so that credentialed checks can be executed.","","","","IAVB #0001-B-0503","Nov 19, 2023 05:03:39 EST","Mar 23, 2025 18:16:56 EDT","N/A","N/A"

  - A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Expressway Series could allow an     unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against a user of the     interface. This vulnerability exists because the web-based management interface does not properly validate     user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the interface to     click a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in     the context of the affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based information. Note:Cisco     Expressway Series refers to Cisco Expressway Control (Expressway-C) devices and Cisco Expressway Edge     (Expressway-E) devices. (CVE-2025-20179)

Please note the following :

- This plugin reports per protocol, so it is possible for   valid credentials to be provided for one protocol and not   another. For example, authentication may succeed via SSH   but fail via SMB, while no credentials were provided for   an available SNMP service.

- Providing valid credentials for all available   authentication protocols may improve scan coverage, but   the value of successful authentication for a given   protocol may vary from target to target depending upon   what data (if any) is gathered from the target via that   protocol. For example, successful authentication via SSH   is more valuable for Linux targets than for Windows   targets, and likewise successful authentication via SMB   is more valuable for Windows targets than for Linux   targets.","","","","","IAVB #0001-B-0504","Mar 28, 2025 03:15:54 EDT","Mar 28, 2025 04:07:35 EDT","N/A","N/A"

  - First, the top of the certificate chain sent by the     server might not be descended from a known public     certificate authority. This can occur either when the     top of the chain is an unrecognized, self-signed     certificate, or when intermediate certificates are     missing that would connect the top of the certificate     chain to a known public certificate authority.

  - Second, the certificate chain may contain a certificate     that is not valid at the time of the scan. This can     occur either when the scan occurs before one of the     certificate's 'notBefore' dates, or after one of the     certificate's 'notAfter' dates.

  - Third, the certificate chain may contain a signature     that either didn't match the certificate's information     or could not be verified. Bad signatures can be fixed by     getting the certificate with the bad signature to be     re-signed by its issuer. Signatures that could not be     verified are the result of the certificate's issuer     using a signing algorithm that Nessus either does not     support or does not recognize.

If the remote host is a public host in production, any break in the chain makes it more difficult for users to verify the authenticity and identity of the web server.

Please note the following :

- This plugin reports per protocol, so it is possible for   valid credentials to be provided for one protocol and not   another. For example, authentication may succeed via SSH   but fail via SMB, while no credentials were provided for   an available SNMP service.

- Providing valid credentials for all available   authentication protocols may improve scan coverage, but   the value of successful authentication for a given   protocol may vary from target to target depending upon   what data (if any) is gathered from the target via that   protocol. For example, successful authentication via SSH   is more valuable for Linux targets than for Windows   targets, and likewise successful authentication via SMB   is more valuable for Windows targets than for Linux   targets.","","","","","IAVB #0001-B-0504","Mar 28, 2025 03:15:54 EDT","Mar 28, 2025 04:07:35 EDT","N/A","N/A"

Note: This plugin leverages the '-maxdepth' find command option, which is a feature implemented by the GNU find binary. If the target does not support this option, such as HP-UX and AIX devices, users will need to enable 'thorough tests' in their scan policy to run the find command without using a '-maxdepth' argument.","","","","","","Sep 25, 2024 23:52:21 EDT","Apr 1, 2025 03:01:23 EDT","N/A","N/A"
