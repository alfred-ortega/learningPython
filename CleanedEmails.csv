i just need to know what case number to refer to....there's 2 of them
there, apparently the result of me making a prior change to one of my

i just need to understand the functionality and what case number to refer
to...will the case number change every time i make a change? i only

2025-05-01,Austen Huigens - QR1 <austen.huigens@gsa.gov>,[Federal HR Navigator Support] Accessing Fed HR with non-GSA Email Address,"good morning, fedhr team.

i am writing about an issue that was elevated to me, which should be a
quick fix please. one of my portfolio's employees was not able to enter her
personal contact information in fedhr navigator prior to going on
extended leave.

she believes by adding her personal email address she'll be able to log in
and update her retirement paperwork. can you please confirm that retirees
can in fact login using their personal email address and then edit their
selections?

if not, that's all i need to know to myth-bust.

if so, can you please connect me whomever has system admin ability to
update users' accounts in fedhr navigator? then, we'll add wendy's personal
email and phone number to her account so she can use her @comast.net email
to log in.

alternatively, do you advise re-enabling a user's ent account for the time
needed to allow her to enter her personal contact information into fedhr
herself and then disabling the ent account again once completed?

whichever of these options is best, let's please take the action.

thank you all for your assistance,

2025-05-02,Austen Huigens - QR1 <austen.huigens@gsa.gov>,Re: [Federal HR Navigator Support] Accessing Fed HR with non-GSA Email Address,"thank you, lauren.

having your explanation will help my staff know how to respond to similar
future inquiries.

✅ i confirmed with the employee that she does indeed have her retirement
specialist's contact information.

❓ so using the direct link you provided, you're saying she will be able to
log into fedhr navigator using her gsa.gov email address even though it's
been deactivated as long as okta verify has been set up with her personal
email address: wendy cobb <jcobb38@comcast.net>? do i have that right?

have a great weekend!

i submitted my retirement package last week and need to update my
retirement date (from 31 aug 2025 to 31 dec 2025) on my form sf 3701.

i cannot figure out how to do that on the fedhr navigator site.

i reached out to my gsa hr poc yesterday and haven't heard back yet. i am
sure she is swamped.

is there a way i can update this information on the website?

thanks.

2025-05-06,Laura Marble - 5P1NAB <laura.marble@gsa.gov>,[Federal HR Navigator Support] How to access to HR Navigator after offboarding from GSA,"good morning.  can you confirm if there is a way to access hr navigator
after a gsa employee has offboarded from the agency and no longer has a piv
card, gsa laptop or gsa email?

i have my own login.gov account but don't see this as an option for the
program.  is it possible to access the program after departure from gsa?  i
expect that i'll need to change my retirement date to an earlier date but
won't know this by the time i depart next week.
